1. Purpose & Goals (What the UI must solve)
CryptoFi is a regulated PKR-to-crypto wallet and instant cross-border remittance app. The UI must:

Make complex financial flows (onboarding, fiat ↔ crypto conversion, international send) feel simple, fast, and trustworthy.

Work for both smartphone users and lower-tech/feature-phone users (with fallback via USSD/SMS).

Bridge trust deficits in crypto through transparency and clear feedback.

Support bilingual (English/Urdu) and RTL needs seamlessly.

2. Core Design Principles (to guide every decision)
Zero-friction onboarding: Minimize typing, use phone+OTP, OCR for CNIC, and biometric login options early. Show progress so users know where they are.

Trust through transparency: Surface fees upfront, show real-time status of transfers, proof-of-reserves cues, and clear compliance badges.

Simplicity over noise: Prioritize key actions, avoid clutter, use progressive disclosure for advanced features.

Accessibility & performance: WCAG-compliant contrast, large touch targets, keyboard/screen-reader support, low-bandwidth optimizations for slow networks. 
MeitY

Localization & RTL correctness: Full layout mirroring for Urdu, appropriate typography pairing, and testing for right-to-left flows.

Mobile-first and responsive: Prioritize mobile UX but ensure scalable components for web; optimize for perceived speed.

3. Key User Flows & Screens to Design First
(These are the MVP/core flows; each should have hi-fi mockups + interactive prototype)

A. Onboarding & KYC
Phone number + OTP entry

CNIC capture with live OCR and quality feedback

Selfie/live detection with anti-spoofing hints

Tiered KYC progress indicator (basic → enhanced → premium)

Trust explanations (“Why we need this”) and data usage transparency. 
ProCreator
UXDA

B. Dashboard / Home
Combined PKR + crypto balances

Quick actions (Add Money, Send Money, Exchange, Help)

Recent activity with status labels and ability to act (retry, share receipt)

Educational nudges for first-time users. 
Netguru
Webstacks

C. Send Money (International & Domestic)
Country selection with flags & recent recipients

Recipient management (saved, new)

Live quote with break-down of fees, conversion, ETA

Review/confirm with security step (PIN/biometric)

Real-time status tracker and shareable receipt. 
Netguru
UXDA

D. Exchange (PKR ↔ USDT/BTC/ETH)
Select asset, live rate preview, slippage warning

Terms & small tooltips explaining what the user is doing

Confirmation with transparent spread/fee display

Portfolio snapshot after trade. 
Medium
Webstacks

E. Help & Support
Contextual help (inline “why did this fail?”)

Live chat / WhatsApp quick access

Self-serve FAQs adapted to persona language (Urdu/English)

Issue reporting with easy repro steps. 
Netguru
UX4Sight

F. Settings & Profile
Language toggle (EN/UR) with immediate layout adaptation

Security (2FA, device management)

KYC status and upgrade path

Privacy controls and data deletion request. 
DashDevs: Fintech Software Solutions

G. Feature-Phone Fallback (USSD/SMS)
Simplified menu-style flows (send, check balance, request help)

Explicit mapping of core actions to short codes

Lightweight confirmations and error handling. 
Itexus

4. Component Requirements (to include in the Figma library)
Buttons: Primary/secondary/tertiary, disabled, loading

Form fields: OTP inputs, masked inputs (CNIC), validation states, inline errors

Cards: Balance, transaction, recipient, quote breakdown

Progress indicators: Onboarding steps, transfer status

Microcopy: Explanatory captions, tooltips, trust blurbs (“Regulated by PVARA”, “Proof of reserves”)

Modal patterns: Confirm, error recovery, educational tips

Responsive navigation (bottom tab for mobile, sidebar for web)

RTL-aware versions of every component (mirrored icons, reversed pagination/back behavior).

5. Trust & Security UI Patterns
Upfront fee breakdown with “you pay / they receive” comparison

Visual proof-of-reserves indicator (e.g., small badge with “Updated X minutes ago”)

Transaction status with step-by-step ticks and estimated times

Clear error messages with actionable recovery (don’t just say “failed”).

Netguru

6. Localization & RTL Details
Mirror entire layout for Urdu, including navigation, back-arrow logic, swipe directions.

Choose appropriate Urdu typography (e.g., Noto Nastaliq) with line-height/ligature handling.

Label hierarchy that works in both languages without truncation.

Fallback font stack that gracefully degrades.

Testing harness for RTL vs LTR toggling in the prototype.

7. Accessibility & Low-Bandwidth Considerations
Contrast ratios ≥4.5:1; large touch targets (44x44px)

Keyboard navigability and screen-reader labels (semantic markup equivalents in app)

Skeleton loaders to reduce perceived wait, avoid content shift

Optional “lite” mode: reduce imagery, textual summaries, deferred sync for spotty networks. 
MeitY

8. Interaction & Micro-Feedback
Success feedback (confetti / subtle celebration) for first transfer

Shake on incorrect PIN, inline validation before submission

Pull-to-refresh for balances, swipe actions on transaction list (e.g., “repeat”, “share”)

Timers for quotes with visual urgency (countdowns). 
UX4Sight

9. Initial Deliverables for Designer
Component Library: Tokens (color, typography, spacing), button styles, form controls, cards, modals with RTL variants.

High-Fidelity Flows: Onboarding, send money, exchange, dashboard, support.

RTL / Bilingual Prototype: Toggleable language with mirrored UI.

Accessibility Checklist: Annotated screens showing compliance.

Design Token Export: For engineers (CSS variables / Tailwind mapping).

Interactive Prototype: Clickable demo for user testing on mobile.

Usability Test Plan: Script for 5–8 users per persona to validate clarity of onboarding and remittance flow.

10. Success Metrics to Drive Iteration (for design handoff context)
Onboarding completion rate

Time-to-first-transaction

Drop-off points in send/exchange flows

User-reported trust (post-transaction survey)

Localization error rate (language toggle usage without confusion)

Accessibility issue count from audits.

Summary for the Designer to Start With
“Build a mobile-first, bilingual (EN/UR) remittance+crypto wallet that feels as easy as texting, and as trustworthy as a regulated bank. Start with a shared Figma component system (with mirrored RTL variants), zero-friction onboarding (phone+OCR+biometrics), clear send/exchange flows with transparent pricing, and layered support. Design for both full-smartphone users and low-bandwidth/feature-phone fallback. Embed trust visually, make recovery easy, and ensure accessibility from the first screen.”
